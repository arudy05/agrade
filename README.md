# agrade
A work-in-progress program for storing information related to keeping track of grades.

There are 2 components:
- libagrade - the library with functionality for grade data
- agrade - the actual program (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Do not expect this to be reliable just yet; I still have some stuff I need/want to work out.
