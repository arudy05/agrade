A work-in-progress library for storing information related to keeping track of grades.

Do not expect this to be reliable just yet; I still have some stuff I need/want to work out. I'll probably eventually use this as a basis to make something that replaces my current system of keeping track of my grades (which is a beast of a spreadsheet).
